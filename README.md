his research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-
Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to
the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by [18]. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by
a target date while minimizing the investor’s periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile
market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement
learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio
from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in
highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that
while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., λ = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfo-
lio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already
enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning
applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively
align portfolio management strategies with investor needs
